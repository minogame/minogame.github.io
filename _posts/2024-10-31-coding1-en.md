When I say "useless," I mean useless. Even if you know these, you won't actually be asked them in most interviews.

So why does the article have this crappy title? Because these are the questions I ask in interviews, and based on my experience, 80% of candidates can't write them out within 30 minutes, even using the most basic methods. Anyone who can write them out using the most basic methods within 30 minutes, I consider to have met the minimum standard for training large models.

Of course, the average Zhihu user can write them in 3 seconds, so please don't mock how simple the questions are, or how foolish the reference answers might be. In short,

So if you also think these are useless, you are correct.

**I. Transpose a nested list**
Problem:

{% highlight python linenos %}
# Python

# Given a nested list foo = [ [A, B], [C, D] ],
# transpose it to bar = [ [A, C], [B, D] ].
# The nested items can be lists, tuples, or other iterable objects.
# The type of A is arbitrary; it can even be a list.
{% endhighlight %}

Reference Answer:

{% highlight python linenos %}
bar = list(zip(*foo))
{% endhighlight %}

Follow-up Question:

{% highlight python linenos %}
# If the sublists in foo have unequal lengths, how should transposition be done according to the longest/shortest sublist?
{% endhighlight %}

---
**II. Group tuples in a list**
Problem:

{% highlight python linenos %}
# Python

# Given a list of tuples foo = [ (A, 1), (B, 2), (C, 2), (D, 1) ],
# group the list by the last element of the tuples into bar = [ [ (A, 1), (D, 1) ], [ (B, 2), (C, 2) ]].
# The length of the tuples is not fixed, and the types of elements within the tuples are also arbitrary.
# Try to use official libraries as much as possible.
{% endhighlight %}

Reference Answer:

{% highlight python linenos %}
from itertools import groupby

# Sort by the grouping element
sorted_foo = sorted(foo, key=lambda x: x[-1])

# Call the official black magic
grouped_data = groupby(sorted_foo, key=lambda x: x[-1]) 

# Expand into a list
bar = [ list(f) for _, f in grouped_data ]
{% endhighlight %}

Follow-up Question:

{% highlight python linenos %}
# How to group based on the type of the last element in the tuple?
{% endhighlight %}

**III. Pick the median value**
Problem:

{% highlight python linenos %}
# Python

# A list contains some float numbers between -10.0 and 10.0,
# and this list also contains some None values.
# For example, foo = [ -1.0, None, 1.0, None, 0.0 ]
# Now, you are required to return the index of the median value after excluding None values.
# For example, in foo, the median is 0.0, so return bar = 4.
# If there is an even number of valid values, take the one corresponding to the upper median index.
{% endhighlight %}

Reference Answer:

{% highlight python linenos %}
import numpy
foo = [ -1.0, None, 1.0, None, 0.0 ]
# Count the number of Nones
n_none = foo.count(None)

# Replace None with a large number to ensure it doesn't interfere with the sorting of normal values
foo_fix_none = [255.0 if i is None else i for i in foo]

# Calculate the index based on the count of non-None elements
# (len(foo) - n_none) is the count of valid numbers.
# // 2 gives the index of the median (or lower median for even counts in a 0-indexed array of valid numbers).
# numpy.argsort sorts foo_fix_none and returns an array of indices.
# We pick the index from argsort that corresponds to the median element among valid numbers.
index_of_median_among_valid = (len(foo) - n_none) // 2
bar = numpy.argsort(foo_fix_none)[index_of_median_among_valid]
{% endhighlight %}

Follow-up Question:

{% highlight python linenos %}
# How to find the indices of the middle K values?
{% endhighlight %}

---
**IV. Find the position of a number pattern**
Problem:

{% highlight python linenos %}
# Python

# Given a list containing some positive integers (guaranteed to have only positive integers),
# find the index of the last number 1, with the condition that a number 2 exists after this 1 (existence guaranteed).
# For example, foo = [0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0],
# then the output should be bar = 5.
# No restrictions on using black magic from various libraries.
{% endhighlight %}

Reference Answer:

{% highlight python linenos %}
import numpy
foo = [0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0]
# Get indices of all 1s, set others to 0.
# This actually yields an array where elements are index if foo[index]==1, else 0.
indices_of_ones_or_zero = numpy.arange(len(foo)) * (numpy.array(foo) == 1)

# Find the index of the last 2
index_of_last_two = numpy.where(numpy.array(foo) == 2)[0][-1]

# Consider only the part of 'indices_of_ones_or_zero' before the last 2.
# Find the maximum index in this part (which corresponds to the last '1' before the last '2').
bar = numpy.max(indices_of_ones_or_zero[:index_of_last_two])
{% endhighlight %}

Follow-up Question:

{% highlight python linenos %}
# Now there is a 2D numpy array. The above operation is required for each row, but explicit loops cannot be used.
{% endhighlight %}

**V. Print log ordered by subprocess rank**
Problem:

{% highlight python linenos %}
# Python

# A program starts N subprocesses, and these subprocesses have different ranks from 1 to N.
# A function get_rank() is defined in the program that can return the current subprocess's rank.
# Implement a method foo(bar) such that these subprocesses can print bar in order of their rank.
# The get_rank() function has an embedded barrier feature, ensuring all subprocesses synchronize at this point.
# No need to consider the implementation cost.
{% endhighlight %}

Reference Answer:

{% highlight python linenos %}
import time

def foo(bar):
    # Assuming get_rank() returns an integer or string convertible to int.
    # The problem statement says get_rank() returns rank from 1 to N.
    # If it's 0-indexed in practice, adjust sleep accordingly (e.g. sleep(rank) or sleep(rank+1) if ranks are 0 to N-1).
    # Given "1 to N", rank itself is fine for sleep duration.
    rank = int(get_rank()) 

    # Each subprocess sleeps for 'rank' seconds to adjust the order
    time.sleep(rank)

    print(bar)
{% endhighlight %}

Follow-up Question:

{% highlight python linenos %}
# How to make these subprocesses write to a log file in order of their rank?
{% endhighlight %}
